**Task II: Test Automation**

Design a test automation framework for room5.trivago.com that will allow other QA Engineers to  be able to create test cases efficiently. 

**Please cover the following scenarios:**

- Search for any location on Magazine by using the search bar *Done*
- Fill in the contact form and send it (accessible through the footer) *Done*
- Subscribe to the Newsletter *Done*
- Navigate to a destination through the menu on the top left *Done*
- Verify that the links in homepage are working *Done*

Gherkin Test Cases:

1. Given I land on homepage
   When I click on the search icon
   And I enter the location Dusseldorf
   Then I see the relevant articles for that location
   
2. Given I land on homepage
   When I scroll to the footer view
   And I click on the contact form
   And I fill the form with name, email and message
   Then I see the success message for form submission
   
3. Given I land on homepage
   When I scroll to the newsletter view
   And I enter the email address for newsletter subscription
   And I click on the Inspire me button
   Then I see the "You are now checked-in!" message
   
4. Given I land on homepage
   When I click on the top left menu
   And I select the destinations
   And I select Midwest category
   And I select the Michigan state
   Then I see the Michigan page for destinations
   
5. Given I land on homepage
   And I verify all the links status code is 200
   Then I see that all the links are working fine

I have selected Cypress to automate these scenarios because of the cross browser support, CI/CD integration and built-in waiting mechanism making it the ideal choice for web automation. 

# Steps to setup Cypress:

## Short Steps:
- Clone this Repository and cd to the repository directory
- Run `npx cypress run` command to execute the automated tests
- Once tests are executed successfully, you will see a report automatically generated by Cypress incdicating the Pass/Fail plus the time taken by each test
- Enjoy Testing!

## Long Steps:

- git clone https://github.com/mujjazi/curly-octo-potato.git
- cd .\curly-octo-potato\
- npm install cypress --save-dev
- npx cypress open (manual execution)
or
- npx cypress run (automated execution)

## Pros of using Cypress:
- Automated Reports

- CI Integration with GitHub actions
- Parallel execution using CI tools and cross browser and platform support
- Built-in waiting mechanism
- API testing
- Stable tests

## Cons of using Cypress:

- Lack of iframe support
- Only JavaScript language bindings
- lack of mobile testing support
